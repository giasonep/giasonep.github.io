I am a former risk manager and market-maker on the CBOE and CME who fulfilled my lifelong dream of opening a successful Italian restaurant. However, with my passion still in data, analytics and problem solving, Data Science was the perfect field to combine my past experiences with computer technology. To bridge my background in social statistics, the markets, and entrepreneurship I attended Metis, a rigorous accredited Data Science and Engineering Bootcamp, to sharpen the technical skills needed to quantify and programmatically express new ideas. Within the field of Data Science, my main interests are data sourcing and cleaning, algorithmic modeling, and providing real-world impact through experimentation, analysis, and implementation.

Notable skills include but are not limited to:

• Python
• SQL
• Pandas
• Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Supervised & Unsupervised)
• NLP
• Web-Scraping
• Google Cloud
